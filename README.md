👋 Hi, I’m @tanjaloponen

👀 I'm a Bachelor of Business Administration from TAMK (2013) and have been working in a law firm for the past ten years. Now I’m interested in changing 
 my career to tech industry. I found #mimmitkoodaa program in 2019 and since then I've attended several workshops in different companies and studied programming 
 (Python) in the open university. From 2020 I've been studying in a "transformation program" at HAMK to become a Bachelor of Business Administration 
 (Computer Applications). Tietojenkäsittelyn tradenomi in Finnish. I'm almost done with the coursework and will do my thesis by the end of the year 2022. 
 I don't have a topic yet but I'm interested for example in data engineering, databases, cloud environments and RPA and hoping to find a subject close to 
 some of the before-mentioned.
 
🌱 I’m currently finishing my last courses and learning about Azure, databases in cloud, Linux and ERP systems. I'm also learning to publish my projects in Github
 and to believe in my skills and dreams and that includes trying to find my first job in the IT industry.
 
💞️ Through my studies I have skills/knowledge in the following subjects: 
        - Basics of databases, MySQL, AzureSQL, MongoDB
        - Programming with Python and Java
        - Windows environment control, Linux
        - Azure (Logic Apps, VMs, DataFactory)
        - Web development ( HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP)
        - RPA with UiPath
        - Testing processes, automation testing with Robot Framework (Selenium Library)
        - PowerBI
        - Wordpress
        - Scrum, Kanban
        - Also a lot of knowledge of business / economic matters.

📫 If you'd wish to contact me regarding for example networking, thesis ideas, job offers, tips to Github projects or something else,
  please send me an email to tanja.e.loponen@gmail.com.
