👋 Hi, I’m @tanjaloponen

 I'm a Bachelor of Business Administration from TAMK (2013) and have been working in a law firm for the past ten years. Now I’m interested in changing 
 my career to tech industry. I found #mimmitkoodaa program in 2019 and since then I've attended several workshops in different companies and studied programming 
 (Python) in the open university. From 2020 I've been studying in a "transformation program" at HAMK to become a Bachelor of Business Administration 
 (Computer Applications). Tietojenkäsittelyn tradenomi in Finnish. I'm almost done with the coursework, currently writing my thesis and will graduate by the end of the year 2022. 
 
 👀 I'm interested for example in RPA, test automation, data engineering, databases, cloud environments and backend in common.
 
🌱 I’m currently writing my thesis (NewSQL databases as a solution to growing requirements for databases) and studying my last course about IoT architectures. I'm also learning to publish my projects in Github and to believe in my skills and dreams and that includes trying to find my first job in the IT industry.
 
💞️ Through my studies I have skills/knowledge in the following subjects: 
        - Basics of databases, MySQL, AzureSQL, MongoDB
        - Programming with Python and Java
        - Windows environment control, Linux
        - Azure (Logic Apps, VMs, DataFactory)
        - Web development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP)
        - RPA with UiPath
        - Testing processes, automation testing with Robot Framework (Selenium Library)
        - PowerBI
        - Wordpress
        - Scrum, Kanban
        - Also a lot of knowledge of business / economic matters.
